# Running a Complete Responsive Website Built with ReactJS and Tailwind CSS in VS Code

## Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm installed on your system. You can download and install them from the official Node.js website: [Node.js Official Website](https://nodejs.org/).
- Visual Studio Code installed on your system. You can download and install it from the official website: [Visual Studio Code Official Website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## Instructions 

1. **Clone or Download the GitHub Repository**: Clone or download the GitHub repository containing the ReactJS and Tailwind CSS project to your local machine. You can use the `git clone` command in the terminal or download the ZIP file from GitHub and extract it.

2. **Open the Project in VS Code**: Open Visual Studio Code, and use the File menu to navigate to the folder where you cloned or extracted the project. Open the folder in VS Code.

3. **Install Dependencies**: Open a terminal within VS Code (Terminal -> New Terminal) and navigate to the root directory of your project. Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:
**npm install**

4. **Start the Development Server**: After installing dependencies, you can start the development server. In the terminal, run:**npm start**
This command will start a development server and open your default web browser, displaying the website. The development server will automatically reload the page if you make edits to the code.

5. **Access the Website**: Once the development server is running, you can access the website by opening a web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:3000` or another port specified in the terminal where the development server is running.
